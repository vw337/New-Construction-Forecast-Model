# New-Construction-Optimal-Pricing-Model
Problem: Should New Construction sales team charge their customers a flat price per Community or per Lead Received?

The purpose of this project is to decide which pricing model is the most optimal for a real estate listing service that specializes in new construction. 

Given several assumptions the goal is to forecast each pricing model over several years and see which pricing model produces the most revenue. 

I also consider the potential advantages and disadvantages to choosing each option. Lastly I aslo look into the concerns and opportunies to consider.
